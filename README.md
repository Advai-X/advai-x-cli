`advai-cli` is a unified command-line interface for managing local skills, working with external CLIs, and chatting with AI from the terminal through a single `advai` entrypoint.

It is designed as a lightweight Python-first core with npm and Homebrew distribution options, making it easy to install in different developer environments while keeping the runtime model simple and predictable.

## Why advai-cli

- One entrypoint for runtime inspection, local skill management, external CLI workflows, and terminal-native AI chat
- Python core for a small, dependency-light implementation
- npm wrapper for teams that prefer JavaScript-based distribution
- Homebrew formula for macOS-friendly installation
- OpenAI-compatible backend support for flexible AI provider integration
- Local-first state stored under `~/.advai`

## Highlights

- Inspect the current installation, runtime, and recommended update command with `advai info` and `advai update`
- Manage locally installed skills with install, list, info, update, and uninstall commands
- Sync installed skills into platform-specific agent directories such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, TRAE, and more
- Discover and install supported third-party CLIs through the OpenCLI ecosystem
- Create local knowledge bases, add documents, search content, and resync from source files
- Proxy supported external CLIs through `advai cli <name> ...`
- Launch a terminal chat UI with configurable model, base URL, system prompt, and transcript export

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python `3.8+`
- Node.js `14+` only if you install through npm
- A local Python runtime is still required when using the npm package
- `opencli` is required only for external CLI discovery, install, and passthrough execution

advai tui --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1
advai tui --system-prompt "You are a concise terminal coding assistant."
advai tui --timeout 180
```

### Environment variables

`advai-cli` supports both `ADVAI_*` and part of the standard `OPENAI_*` naming for compatibility.

### In-session TUI commands

```bash
/help
/clear
/agent
/agent default
/model
/model gpt-4o-mini
/system You are a helpful assistant.
/save ./chat.md
/exit
```

Run `/agent` with no arguments to open an interactive agent picker.
Run `/model` with no arguments to open an interactive model picker. Use the up and down arrow keys to choose a model, then press Enter to confirm.

## Skills

Skills are stored locally under `~/.advai/skills`.

```bash
advai skill list
advai skill platform list
advai skill info demo-skill
advai skill install https://github.com/your-org/skill-repo
advai skill install https://github.com/your-org/skill-repo --skill demo-skill
advai skill install https://github.com/your-org/skill-repo --skill demo-skill --platform cursor
advai skill sync demo-skill --platform trae
advai skill sync demo-skill --platform omp_agent --project-dir /path/to/repo
advai skill unsync demo-skill --platform cursor
advai skill platform add custom_agent --name "Custom Agent" --path ~/.custom-agent/skills
advai skill platform override cursor --path ~/.cursor/skills
advai skill update demo-skill
advai skill uninstall demo-skill
```

### Supported platforms

`advai skill sync --platform <key>` currently includes `51` built-in platform adapters, plus custom platform support through `advai skill platform add`.

#### Lobster platforms

| Key | Platform |
| --- | --- |
| `autoclaw` | AutoClaw |
| `easyclaw` | EasyClaw |
| `hermes` | Hermes Agent |
| `openclaw` | OpenClaw |
| `qclaw` | QClaw |
| `workbuddy` | WorkBuddy |

#### Custom platforms

- Use `advai skill platform add <key> --name <name> --path <dir>` to register any additional agent or internal platform that stores skills on disk.
- Use `advai skill platform override <key> --path <dir>` or `--project-path <dir>` to adapt built-in platform paths to your local setup.

Current scope:

- GitHub installs read from the repository root `skills/` directory instead of copying the whole repo
- If the repo `skills/` directory contains one skill, `advai` installs it automatically
- If the repo `skills/` directory contains multiple skills, `advai` prompts whether to install all of them; use `--skill <name>` to choose one explicitly
- `advai skill update <name>` reuses the saved GitHub repo URL and selected skill directory when the installed skill came from GitHub
- `advai skill install` and `advai cli install` currently support GitHub repository URLs only
- Built-in platform adapters cover common coding and lobster-style agents, and custom platforms can be added locally
- `advai skill sync` supports `symlink` and `copy` modes for writing skills into platform-specific directories
- `advai skill install <github-url> --platform <key>` installs locally first, then syncs into each selected platform
- `advai skill uninstall <name>` removes the local skill and cleans up any synced platform targets recorded in metadata
- Platforms with project-local skills directories can be targeted with `--project-dir`

## External CLI Integration

External CLI support is powered by `opencli`.

```bash
advai cli list
advai cli info demo-cli
advai cli install https://github.com/your-org/cli-repo
advai cli install https://github.com/your-org/cli-repo --cli demo-cli
advai cli update demo-cli --yes
advai cli uninstall demo-cli --yes
advai cli demo-cli --help
```

Notes:

- `advai cli list`, `advai cli info`, `advai cli install`, `advai cli update`, and `advai cli uninstall` require `opencli` to be installed and available on `PATH`
- GitHub CLI installs read from the repository root `clis/` directory and register each selected CLI via `opencli external register`
- If the repo `clis/` directory contains multiple CLIs, `advai` prompts whether to install all of them; use `--cli <name>` to choose one explicitly
- Dynamic passthrough execution works only for CLIs exposed by the local OpenCLI registry
- `advai-cli` does not reimplement third-party CLIs; it provides a consistent entrypoint and installation surface

## Knowledge Bases

Knowledge bases are stored locally under `~/.advai/kbs`.

`advai kb` is also designed to be OKF-friendly. Based on the Open Knowledge Format (OKF) direction described by Google Cloud, the current implementation already works well with knowledge bundles that are organized as markdown files on disk, including files that contain YAML frontmatter.

```bash
advai kb create team-wiki
advai kb doc add team-wiki ./README.md
advai kb search team-wiki homebrew
advai kb sync team-wiki
```

Current scope:

- `advai kb create <name>` initializes a local knowledge base directory and metadata file
- `advai kb doc add <name> <path>` copies a source document into the knowledge base and tracks its original path
- `advai kb search <name> <query>` performs a simple case-insensitive text search over stored document content
- `advai kb sync <name>` refreshes stored copies from the original source paths and reports any missing files
- OKF-friendly ingestion: markdown-based knowledge docs can be added directly without conversion
- YAML frontmatter is preserved as plain text, so OKF metadata remains searchable and does not get stripped during add or sync
- This version does not yet implement full OKF-aware parsing, validation, or structured metadata querying; it focuses on filesystem-native storage and simple text retrieval first

## Development

### Run from source

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
advai --help
python -m advai.cli info
```

### Packaging model

- PyPI ships the Python implementation directly
- npm publishes a thin wrapper that locates Python and forwards to the Python CLI
- Homebrew installs the Python package through a formula-managed virtual environment

## Operational Notes

- Local state lives under `~/.advai`
- Knowledge bases are stored under `~/.advai/kbs`
- Skills are stored under `~/.advai/skills`
- The recommended self-update command changes depending on whether the tool was installed via `pip`, `npm`, or `brew`
- npm installation checks for a working Python interpreter during `postinstall`
